Hello everybody (mainly Christian)! To get this started you need to do a couple of things.

1. Have NodeJS installed and MongoDB installed (for MongoDB just npm install -g mongodb should work)

2. Install KeystoneJS! (npm install -g keystone-generator)

3. Create a .env file:
	a. In terminal, type "vi .env"
	b. You need a Cloudinary account, a Mailchimp account, and a cookie secret passcode. Ask me if you just want to use mine and I'll send it to you.

4. Once you pull this repo down:
	a. Change into its directory
	b. type "npm install" into terminal

5. Activate MongoDB (in a terminal window, type "mongod" if you haven't already set it up to autorun when installing it)

6. Change into the directory and type "node keystone" in terminal

7. Project should be on localhost on port 3000

8. ENJOY!
